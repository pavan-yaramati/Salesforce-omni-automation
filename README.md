# Salesforce Omni-Channel Automation

This repository showcases the custom case routing logic, Flow automation, and Apex code solutions I've built for Salesforce Omni-Channel, including capacity-based assignment and real-time status updates.

### ðŸ”¹ Project 1: Smart Case Assignment Flow
- Route cases based on presence status (Ready/Busy)
- Prevent multiple case overload by auto-flipping to Busy
- Restore eligibility after specific status changes (Escalated/On Hold)
